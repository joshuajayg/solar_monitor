#MQTT Server scripts

All these scripts are run on my mqtt server.  It's a Raspberry Pi running an access point and connected via ethernet
to my home router.  The pi is the MQTT broker with a static IP (since it is an access point), runs and SQLite database to store the data, and updates my database on a hosted server to display the data on my webpage.
