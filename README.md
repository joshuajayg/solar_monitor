# Solar Monitor

This is a solar power production and use monitoring system based on the LTC4151 IC by Analog.  Data is read by an ESP8266, sent over wifi using MQTT to a Raspberry Pi, stored in a database, then uploaded to a hosted webserver for display.  It is a work in progress but I plan to share all my scripts, web pages, and hardware designs here to help me solve problems and guide people in the right direction who want to setup a similar system.
